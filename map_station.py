    China Meteorological Station Temperature Trends Visualization Script

    Description:
        This script is designed to visualize temperature trends observed at meteorological stations across China. 
        It reads in temperature trend data from CSV files and plots these trends on a map of China. The visualization 
        specifically highlights the temperature changes recorded at individual meteorological stations, with a color-coded 
        representation to illustrate the variation in temperature trends.

    Key Functions:
        1. Data Reading: Loads temperature trend data for meteorological stations from a CSV file.
        2. Map Integration: Uses a shapefile to create a geographic map of China for visualization.
        3. Data Visualization: Plots each meteorological station on the map, using color-coding to represent the 
           observed temperature trends.
        4. Custom Color Mapping: Implements a custom colormap to effectively demonstrate the range of temperature changes.

    Preparation:
        - Ensure that the temperature trend data file, named 'China_city_temperature_trends2.csv', is placed in the 
          same directory as the script.
        - The shapefile for China's map, located in the 'Chinamap' directory, should be accessible to the script.

    Usage:
        Run the script with the following command:
        python map_station.py
